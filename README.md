### To use the webapp:

1. Enter the alphabets, variable(states), start states and final states. To enter Epsilon, enter <Epsilon> (Don't need <>). It's case sensitive.Then, click on the "proceed" to save it.

Note: Only up to 3 alphabets + E, and only up to 4 variables. Also, always put Epsilon as the last alphabet.

2. Go to the bottom table to fill in the transition. If you want to fill in more than one alphabet in a box. Eg: For state A, when 0, it is {B,C}. Just type in B,C (Don't need {}). To enter 'empty', enter </> without <>.

Note: The state name in the transition much match the state name previously set in the previous table.

Click onto the "proceed" button to save it.

You can view the tables and the side. Just click on the buttons.
The transitions will be saved in the variables object. View more in the index.js file.
